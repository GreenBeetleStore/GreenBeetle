                     <h2>The Personal Improvement ...</h2>
                     <p>PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT IMPOSES A CHANGE THROUGH WHICH A PERSON ACQUIRES A SERIES OF QUALITIES THAT IMPROVE HIS LIFE.</p>
                  </header>
                  <p>It is about seeking and finding a state of satisfaction with ourselves and the circumstances around us.</p>
                  <p>But, a process of change causes fear and insecurity, mainly due to deeply rooted erroneous beliefs. It is difficult to banish these beliefs and move beyond fear.</p>
                  <p>Many people complain about what they have in their lives, but do nothing to change it. Every day they demonstrate their dissatisfaction, but also their immobility. If you are not happy with what surrounds you, it is time to move and not stop.</p>
                  <p>Don't settle, don't stop looking, let curiosity guide your days. Remember how you explored the world when you were a child and recover this way of seeing life, of living an adventure every second, without stopping.</p>
                  <p>When we face a new challenge it seems very complicated, full of uncertainty and stresses us, but this is the barrier we have to overcome to be who we want to be and not what others expect of us.</p>
                  <p>Over time, what was initially difficult becomes easy because we learn to overcome our fears, to assume them and to face them. We recognize them and face them, manage them and they cease to be a threat to become a motivation.</p>
                  <p>We often tend to give priority to other people, we turn ourselves into others, what they want and what they need, by making them happy, sometimes paying the price of our own happiness. Where are we ?</p>
                  <span class="image main"
                     ><img src="images/accesstests03.webp" alt="Update"
                  /></span>
                  <p>It's time to become your own priority, to know that sometimes you have to be ahead, that you need some time for yourself. It's not about being selfish, it's about thinking in a balanced way about others and yourself. You deserve to be happy.</p>
                  <p>We deserve to be happy and sometimes we forget that. We tend to do what we think makes others happy and we don't reflect on what we are passionate about, what fills our hearts and makes us smile.</p>
                  <p>You also deserve to enjoy happiness, you deserve to have your heart and soul full of joy, to squeeze every moment, to have dreams fulfilled and to fulfill, to transmit your passion and to feel loved. You are brave and take risks.</p>
                  <p>The biggest obstacle when it comes to changing and overcoming ourselves is fear, because there is always a risk. Managing this fear without avoiding it, simply facing it, is what makes us learn and grow in life.</p>
                  <p>In order to grow as people, we will always have to take risks and not forget that in our bet there is also a risk of failure, but this failure will be a learning experience, a way to get to know each other better and to know how to react to fears .</p>
                  <p>In this life it is not possible to fully realize everything we can wish for, but if you follow your instincts and your heart you will see that new opportunities always appear according to the circumstances, <b>take advantage of them !</b></p>
                  <p><b>If you don't try, you'll never know what you're capable of, so do it !</b></p>
