                     I was born in Sant Carles de la Ràpita, a Mediterranean
                     city in the south of Catalonia where I grew up, which is
                     now simply called La Ràpita. <br /><a

                     with a wide range of activities in nature and cultural
                     events throughout the year.<br />The geographic enclave of
                     the municipality between sea, river, sky and mountains
                     feeds us a wide variety of ecosystems giving us a sweet,
                     warm and very healthy climate. <br />As a Mediterranean
                     city, its inhabitants are open to all cultures, they are
                     hospitable and hardworking, with a great resilience
                     developed by their community solidarity.<br />My parents,
                     born and members of this friendly community, were engaged
                     in agriculture and poultry farming, my sister was a teacher
                     and my brother an industrial master, and my first vocation
                     was to be an Electronic Engineer.<br />

                     At the end of my basic general education I completed the
                     first part of my formation in electricity and electronics
                     at the Polytechnic Institute of Professional Training in
                     Tortosa, with the pride of being the only one and the first
                     to complete the studies with all approved subjects.<br />I
                     continued the second part of my studies until the 4th year
                     at the Comte de Rius Institute in Tarragona, taking
                     advantage of the summers in seasonal works, until I
                     suffered a serious traffic accident.

                  <p>
                     The accident was very serious and almost fatal with serious
                     physical consequences, which put me out of action for a
                     good 3 years and truncated my career and my adolescence.<br />In
                     any case, <b>I can feel lucky</b> to keep my left arm that
                     was torn off, and thanks to the evolution of medicine I
                     have it moderately operative.

                     I used the season of my recovery therapy to do an
                     administrative assistant course with accounting techniques
                     and office practice at the Cots Academy in Tortosa,
                     strengthening my languages.<br /><br /><b

                     ><br /><br />For a while I went to a relative's office to
                     help with billing and administration. It was the first time
                     I worked with a computer, an
                     <b>PC IBM 286 with 2Mb of RAM</b> running under
                     <b>MS-DOS</b>.<br />

                     In my spare moments I started to teach myself how to
                     program small applications with this language.<br />The
                     advertisements of that time offered the first
                     microcomputers for personal use at affordable prices (<b
                        >Spectrum, Amstrad, Commodore, MSX, ...</b
                     >).<br />
                     For Christmas I was given a <b>Sony MSX</b> that connected
                     to the TV, and it worked with code cartridges or a tape
                     recorder to load or save the code.

                     A job opportunity knocked on my door, with administrative
                     work in media research for a commercial advertising
                     company.<br />
                     It didn't last long, about 7 or 8 months.<br />After, I
                     teamed up with a colleague from this job creating a company
                     to offer various advertising services "<b
                        >Publicitat Vázquez-Torta, CB</b
                     >".<br />
                     We offer: creation of logos, posters, writing and
                     contracting of spaces in radios, magazines and outdoor
                     advertising banners, advertising objects, print
                     reproductions, signage, decoration of commercial facades,
                     etc.<br />
                     In the beginning we did everything by hand, with a drawing
                     table, a typewriter and a telephone. <br />A professional
                     computer was unthinkable due to the high prices and poor
                     performance.<br />

                     The property community dissolved and within a few months I
                     set up as a freelancer offering visual graphic design and
                     printing services.<br />
                     In this new adventure, I acquired my first professional
                     computer, a <b>PC AT-386 with 16 MB of RAM</b> running by
                     <b>Windows 3.1</b>, and an A4 laser printer at 300 dpi,
                     which when called by hardware outputted a resolution of
                     1200 dpi.<br />
                     The labor saving was impressive, especially in the making
                     of the original clichés.

                     The first big revolution was the appearance of
                     <b>Windows 3.11</b> which had features for connecting
                     computers to a network. That time was very exciting,
                     technology was gaining momentum with the appearance of the
                     internet, the first <b>Pentium at 66 Mhz</b>, modems at
                     <b>9600 bps</b>, high capacity backup recorders
                     (<b>100Mb</b>). The incredible possibility to chat with the

                     I latched onto this whole technological wave passionately
                     in a self-taught way, evolving at the same pace as graphic
                     design tools, hardware and the internet. I worked a few
                     more years as a freelancer...

                     My intellectual curiosity led me to enroll in the

                     in Amposta, where I was able to develop my artistic skills
                     applied to graphic design. I would like to thank my mentor
                     Antonia Ripoll, teacher of drawing and painting and
                     director of the center at the time, who knew how to awaken
                     my learning motivations.<br />My comfort zone was broken
                     and I had to make the decision to work on contract for
                     third parties, caused by financial necessity due to a
                     series of non-payments by a client who ran a nightclub that
                     I supplied all their merchandising, driving me into
                     bankruptcy.<br />
                     Then, at the same time as my freelance work and training, I
                     worked in Amposta, as a graphic designer; first in a
                     company manufacturing flexographic plates
                     <b><i>"Nou Disseny Clixés i Motllos, SA."</i></b
                     >; and later I worked in <b><i>Flexoservei, SL. </i></b>as
                     a graphic designer, final arts controller and manager of a
                     team of about 6/7 people, in another cardboard packaging
                     manufacturing company <b><i>DAPSA</i></b> where I learned a
                     lot about drafting and applying specific procedures of
                     industrial work, creating relationships and solutions for
                     the different productive sections of the company. <br />My
                     responsibility here grew exponentially, with excessive
                     workloads of between 10 and 14 hours per day. <br />I
                     waited for the end of my contract doing an introspective
                     reflection on personal and work reconciliation.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     After my accident, the doctors informed me that many of the
                     physical activities and sports I practiced would be
                     impossible.<br />
                     I was a young man; restless and, why not say, a bit
                     stubborn, who needed to know and position my limits wanting
                     to strengthen self-confidence.<br />
                     Despite the medical prognosis, I had developed the hobby
                     and the inventiveness to practice a sport that in theory I
                     should not have been able to practice: windsurfing. It was
                     an innovative sport that was growing in strength at the
                     time, which conveyed feelings of freedom and adrenaline.<br />
                     With fortune materials I created different ways to be able
                     to hold the boom and raise the sail and little by little I
                     added muscle mass to the affected arm.<br />

                     One of these young acquaintances with whom I exchanged
                     experiences, had been promoted to lead the sailing section
                     of
                     <a href="https://clubnauticlarapita.com/" target="_blank"

                     and had no idea about computers and we agreed to open a
                     collaborative stage in which he would introduce me to
                     dinghy sailing, and I introduced him to the practice of
                     windsurfing and to develop his computer knowledge and
                     skills.<br />Back then I was working with 3 PCs on a
                     network, one for graphic design, one for administrative
                     management and one that handled printing and storage.<br /><br />Selflessly,
                     I arranged to make room for him in my office, organizing
                     sessions during the week where I lent him a computer and
                     began to teach him how to develop computer skills. <br />I
                     created the new logo for the "<b
                        ><i>EVA · Escola de Vela dels Alfacs</i></b
                     >" and I designed the Sailing Pass for Adults, then was
                     born.<br />In return, I received lessons in light sailing
                     and began to assist the adults who came at the weekend to
                     practice the sport.

                     When I started my sabbatical of reflection, my volunteering
                     gradually turned into a profession. I gained the
                     qualification of Sail Monitor and other complementary
                     qualifications to crew motor boats, accepting temporary
                     work and developing new skills. <br />We grew the sailing
                     offer and new nautical clubs asked for our services to
                     establish their own sailing school and leisure services.
                     <br /><br />I was appointed to direct the sailing school of
                     the

                     , where we included kayaking as a new discipline.<br />We
                     were a team of 4/5 people who shared the work between
                     giving classes, accompanying, creating activities and
                     organizing events. Students who wished could achieve an
                     improvement to start in sports competition. In the off
                     season our work consisted of repairing boats, recovering
                     material and updating all resources for the following
                     season.

                     After this magnificent and nourishing experience, during a
                     time of unemployment I received a job offer from an
                     adventure sports company "<a

                        ><b>Deltaventur</b></a

                     and for all kinds of people: of course light sailing and
                     kayaking, in addition to hiking, bike tours, canyoning,
                     climbing, caving, scuba diving, land multi-adventure, water
                     games, paintball, excursions with quad bikes, tourist
                     excursions in a van, business cohesion activities, etc.<br />
                     My tasks, initially quite generalized and varied, evolved
                     to the point of leading small work teams in the
                     organization and execution of activities. <br /><br />

                     <b>A high level challenge for me !</b><br /><br />
                     When I arrived at the first information session of these
                     new formations, which was given at

                     and expressed my case and asked a great question that left
                     the teachers who were making the presentation speechless:
                     <br /><br /><b
                        ><i
                           >Is it that a person who has a disability, like me,

                        ></b
                     ><br /><br />They reacted very well, with courtesy and
                     kindness, they had a small conversation with each other,
                     then they asked me some questions about my disability, my
                     will and my motivations and then they accepted my
                     pre-registration file, informing me that they would take
                     this into account when carrying out the physical access
                     tests.<br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Once I received my approved registration dossier, I
                     scheduled the dates in my calendar and defined my training
                     strategy to get as close as possible to the requirements of
                     the Mountain Guide Training Access Tests.

                  <p>
                     I immediately went to work, I asked a friend to accompany
                     me and help me with my training until the dates of the
                     entrance exams, prioritizing the disciplines in which I was
                     lacking.<br />
                     Taking advantage of the privileges of my city, where we
                     have the

                     a few singles equipped in climbing areas and has a good
                     number of trails among which there is a very famous one;
                     the <b>GR92</b>.<br />
                     I stocked up on the necessary equipment that I didn't have
                     yet and scheduled the stay at a campsite in
                     <a

                        ><b>Ribes de Freser</b></a
                     >, in the Girona Pyrenees. <br /><br />
                     The first day was an informative meeting, where
                     participation was confirmed and individual numbers, groups
                     and the timetables of the access tests were organised.
                     <br />I had an interview with all the teachers to show my
                     disability so that they could assess it. They reached a
                     consensus where they decided on small adaptations in some
                     of the disciplines in accordance with my disability. <br />
                     As small as the adaptations were, they were very important
                     to me, for example: In climbing they kept the level set,
                     but for me they removed the time limit. In the swimming and
                     in the canyoning course, the time limits increased in
                     percentages. <br /><br />I followed the rhythm of the tests
                     and passed them one after the other. Some involved a lot of
                     effort and difficulty, like climbing, but I kept a fairly
                     stable level of concentration.

                     In the morning, still at night, we prepared the necessary
                     material for each adventure : canyoning, guiding, bivouac,
                     orientation, rescue, facilities, first aid, survival
                     practices, development on the ground in fortune materials,
                     progression in white water , planning itineraries with
                     escape points, etc., quite interesting content although not
                     at all comfortable; we spent the day wet from head to toe
                     with low temperatures and accumulating fatigue. <br />The
                     human side and the relationships between all of us,
                     teachers and students, is what I remember most vividly.

                     I validated all the theoretical training with good results,
                     and in the practical training I was left with two subjects:
                     Progression Techniques and Timed Orientation, which I
                     validated a few months later in the recovery call.<br />
                     At the end of all these cycles, I had validated a few hours
                     of practical internship, but I still needed a few more.<br />
                     I strongly wanted to apply my learning in the world of
                     work, and I traveled to

                     That summer was memorable, a lot of social interaction
                     working in front of the public, organizing groups, putting
                     into practice my acquired skills, and a festive atmosphere
                     that was contagious to you from the tourists of the camping
                     and the seasonal colleagues, plus the local festivals of
                     all the surrounding villages that usually fall in the
                     summer.

                     At the end of the season, we packed up our bags and headed
                     home, with a few bucks and a diploma in my pocket, I faced
                     the autumn and winter with austerity and like every year I
                     dedicated a few weeks to the collection of olives to make
                     olive oil first quality olive, homemade and totally
                     organic. <br />Then it was time to do the maintenance of
                     the land, weeding, pruning, harvesting the carobs,
                     accumulating firewood, and leaving everything in order for
                     the next harvest.<br /><br />
                     This he had not yet told; when my father retired, my
                     brother and I took over the family farm and now we each
                     share half of it. <br />When we are there we are the
                     happiest people in the world, with the Serra del Montsià
                     behind and the Mediterranean in front with the sunrises.<br />

                     Returning to the recreational sports activity, in 2005 I
                     was able to negotiate a better and more professional salary
                     for the tourist season and my main activities at
                     Deltaventur were coordinating the dinghy sailing team
                     leading the activity, as in the descent of canyons and
                     kayaking, whenever there was a schedule of these
                     activities. <br />If I wasn't joining in assisting the
                     other instructors in their activities or doing training
                     sessions for the instructors who wanted to learn to sail.
                     <br />In our down time adventure activity, we were building
                     and repairing fiberglass kayaks, and creating climbing wall
                     sets for the land adventure park, including a mobile one on
                     a trailer. <br /><br />This year and the following two were
                     not as exciting or comfortable as I would have liked, but
                     no less interesting. <br />Working for seasons at the

                     cement factory in <b>Alcanar</b>, doing maintenance and
                     industrial mechanics jobs. <br />A rough, tough task and
                     surrounded by dangers with huge machinery always in motion,
                     with high temperatures and always impregnated with cement
                     dust immersed in sufficiently toxic environments. Working
                     in shifts because it never stops.<br /><br />I learned a
                     bit of mechanics applied to large industry, I learned
                     welding, which I would later take a course, and I also
                     learned a lot about safety rules at work and personal
                     protection.<br /><br />
                     Although it was an unpleasant job, I found the human and
                     social experience very interesting, making new friendships
                     and seeing old friends I hadn't seen for a long time.
                     Sharing the efforts and solidarity to execute the tasks
                     that were assigned to us.

                  <p>
                     It also allowed me to save a bit of salary, because we paid
                     a small bonus for dangerousness, I overcame shifts from 8
                     hours to 10 or 12. If you worked night shifts we had
                     another small bonus for nocturnality and if you worked the
                     bosses during the week you accumulated another little extra
                     holiday day. The payment of accrued vacation days was
                     added.<br /><br />
                     A little here, a little there I accumulated a small amount
                     that I would later use in a new project that was brewing in
                     my brain.

                     trekking routes, of nearby ravines, kayak itineraries, and
                     a lot of questions that little by little transformed into

                     do the competition have and what prices can I offer?
                     <br />· How to differentiate myself? <br />· What minimum
                     material would you need to get started? <br />· Where to
                     get it? How much will it cost? <br />· What budget do I
                     have and what will I need? <br />· What financing can I
                     get? <br />· Who can be my collaborators? <br />· Who will
                     be my clientele? <br />· What added value can I offer them?
                     <br />· What legal status will I establish? <br />· Can I
                     count on opening grants and what are their conditions?

                     I re-armed my small fleet of computers, and the prospecting
                     phase began. <br /><br />I started organizing resources and
                     followed trainings and models to write a good business
                     plan. <br />Taking and analyzing all the questions that
                     came to my mind, once they were classified in an order, I
                     began to answer them one by one and put it on paper in the
                     business plan.

                  <p>
                     And the more questions I answered, the more questions arose; Professional and legal regulations. Local, territorial, national, and natural space regulations. The necessary and complementary insurances ... It was a constant non-stop.
