                     I was born in Sant Carles de la Ràpita, a Mediterranean
                     city in the south of Catalonia where I grew up, which is
                     now simply called La Ràpita. <br /><a

                     with a wide range of activities in nature and cultural
                     events throughout the year.<br />The geographic enclave of
                     the municipality between sea, river, sky and mountains
                     feeds us a wide variety of ecosystems giving us a sweet,
                     warm and very healthy climate. <br />As a Mediterranean
                     city, its inhabitants are open to all cultures, they are
                     hospitable and hardworking, with a great resilience
                     developed by their community solidarity.<br />My parents,
                     born and members of this friendly community, were engaged
                     in agriculture and poultry farming, my sister was a teacher
                     and my brother an industrial master, and my first vocation
                     was to be an Electronic Engineer.<br />

                     At the end of my basic general education I completed the
                     first part of my formation in electricity and electronics
                     at the Polytechnic Institute of Professional Training in
                     Tortosa, with the pride of being the only one and the first
                     to complete the studies with all approved subjects.<br />I
                     continued the second part of my studies until the 4th year
                     at the Comte de Rius Institute in Tarragona, taking
                     advantage of the summers in seasonal works, until I
                     suffered a serious traffic accident.

                     The accident was very serious and almost fatal with serious
                     physical consequences, which put me out of action for a
                     good 3 years and truncated my career and my adolescence.<br />In
                     any case, <b>I can feel lucky</b> to keep my left arm that
                     was torn off, and thanks to the evolution of medicine I
                     have it moderately operative.

                     I used the season of my recovery therapy to do an
                     administrative assistant course with accounting techniques
                     and office practice at the Cots Academy in Tortosa,
                     strengthening my languages.<br /><br /><b

                     help with billing and administration. It was the first time
                     I worked with a computer, an
                     <b>PC IBM 286 with 2Mb of RAM</b> running under
                     <b>MS-DOS</b>.<br />

                     In my spare moments I started to teach myself how to
                     program small applications with this language.<br />The
                     advertisements of that time offered the first
                     microcomputers for personal use at affordable prices (<b
                        >Spectrum, Amstrad, Commodore, MSX, ...</b
                     >).<br />
                     For Christmas I was given a <b>Sony MSX</b> that connected
                     to the TV, and it worked with code cartridges or a tape
                     recorder to load or save the code.

                     A job opportunity knocked on my door, with administrative
                     work in media research for a commercial advertising
                     company.<br />
                     It didn't last long, about 7 or 8 months.<br />After, I
                     teamed up with a colleague from this job creating a company
                     to offer various advertising services "<b
                        >Publicitat Vázquez-Torta, CB</b
                     >".<br />
                     We offer: creation of logos, posters, writing and
                     contracting of spaces in radios, magazines and outdoor
                     advertising banners, advertising objects, print
                     reproductions, signage, decoration of commercial facades,
                     etc.<br />
                     In the beginning we did everything by hand, with a drawing
                     table, a typewriter and a telephone. <br />A professional
                     computer was unthinkable due to the high prices and poor
                     performance.<br />

                     The property community dissolved and within a few months I
                     set up as a freelancer offering visual graphic design and
                     printing services.<br />
                     In this new adventure, I acquired my first professional
                     computer, a <b>PC AT-386 with 16 MB of RAM</b> running by
                     <b>Windows 3.1</b>, and an A4 laser printer at 300 dpi,
                     which when called by hardware outputted a resolution of
                     1200 dpi.<br />
                     The labor saving was impressive, especially in the making
                     of the original clichés.

                     <b>Windows 3.11</b> which had features for connecting
                     computers to a network. That time was very exciting,
                     technology was gaining momentum with the appearance of the
                     internet, the first <b>Pentium at 66 Mhz</b>, modems at
                     <b>9600 bps</b>, high capacity backup recorders
                     (<b>100Mb</b>). The incredible possibility to chat with the

                     I latched onto this whole technological wave passionately
                     in a self-taught way, evolving at the same pace as graphic
                     design tools, hardware and the internet. I worked a few
                     more years as a freelancer...

                     in Amposta, where I was able to develop my artistic skills
                     applied to graphic design. I would like to thank my mentor
                     Antonia Ripoll, teacher of drawing and painting and
                     director of the center at the time, who knew how to awaken
                     my learning motivations.<br />
                     Then, at the same time as my freelance work and training, I
                     worked in Amposta, as a graphic designer; first in a
                     company manufacturing flexographic plates
                     <b><i>"Nou Disseny Clixés i Motllos, SA."</i></b
                     >; and later I worked in <b><i>Flexoservei, SL. </i></b>as
                     a graphic designer, final arts controller and manager of a
                     team of about 6/7 people, in another cardboard packaging
                     manufacturing company <b><i>DAPSA</i></b> where I learned a
                     lot about drafting and applying specific procedures of
                     industrial work, creating relationships and solutions for
                     the different productive sections of the company. <br />My
                     responsibility here grew exponentially, with excessive
                     workloads of between 10 and 14 hours per day. <br />I
                     waited for the end of my contract doing an introspective
                     reflection on personal and work reconciliation.

                     After my accident, the doctors informed me that many of the
                     physical activities and sports I practiced would be
                     impossible.<br />
                     I was a young man; restless and, why not say, a bit
                     stubborn, who needed to know and position my limits wanting
                     to strengthen self-confidence.<br />
                     Despite the medical prognosis, I had developed the hobby
                     and the inventiveness to practice a sport that in theory I
                     should not have been able to practice: windsurfing. It was
                     an innovative sport that was growing in strength at the
                     time, which conveyed feelings of freedom and adrenaline.<br />
                     With fortune materials I created different ways to be able
                     to hold the boom and raise the sail and little by little I
                     added muscle mass to the affected arm.<br />

                     This sports hobby put me in contact with people in this
                     discipline and other sailing sports.
