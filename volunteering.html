                     <b>· You learn from people who are different.</b> Teenagers
                     often find themselves in a bubble in which both family and
                     acquaintances and friends are of the same style. When
                     volunteering young people meet people who are very
                     different from them not only in the socio-economic aspect
                     but also in terms of culture and style. Thus, they broaden
                     their view of the world a little. <br />
                     <b
                        >· Development and increaseof generosity and
                        solidarity.</b
                     >
                     When young people do volunteering, they are allocating part
                     of their free time to dedicate it to others. This will make
                     them develop values such as generosity and solidarity.
                     <br />
                     <b>· Encouraging empathy.</b> By seeing and being with
                     people who are in a complicated situation, whose resources
                     are scarce or who live in a precarious way, this makes the
                     volunteer grow in empathy, putting himself in their place
                     and trying to help them. <br />
                     <b>· Develop commitment and perseverance.</b> Volunteering
                     requires a commitment since the volunteer must comply with
                     the stipulated schedule and tasks and the work must be
                     constant. In this aspect, the volunteer learns to take on
                     responsibilities. <br />
                     <b>· Appreciate and thanks for what you have.</b>
                     Another very important benefit derived from volunteer work
                     is that by seeing the misfortunes of others, you learn to
                     value what you have and to minimize conflicts over
                     insignificant things. In short, you learn to see life with
                     different eyes and to take into account only what is
                     important. <br />
                     <b>· Personal gratification.</b> Another benefit of
                     volunteering is the gratification of seeing your work well
                     done and/or finished. Seeing the results of your help is
                     very comforting. <br />
                     <b>· Talk in public.</b> The opportunity to express
                     yourself in public facilitates the interrelation between
                     other soft skills, and by virtue of practicing this quality
                     is perfected. <br />
                     <b>· Gain experience.</b> Whatever you do in volunteering
                     activities, you can reflect it in your CV. Companies value
                     and give importance to giving time to others selflessly.

                        </header>
                        <p>
                           Sea baptisms are a very simple way of sailing by
                           organizing groups that sail in a flotilla accompanied
                           by a sailing instructor, without having to learn how
                           to sail. <br />The main objective is to promote the
                           practice of sailing by participating in a safe
                           leisure activity, where participants are introduced
                           to this discipline in a fun way and have the
                           opportunity to perform the different tasks of sailing
                           in a group.<br />It is applicable to all ages, but
                           the majority of the participants were students from
                           schools everywhere.

                        <p>
                           The sail, a tool to encourage teamwork. It is a
                           cooperative sport where they work together inside the
                           sailboat promoting solidarity. Beyond enjoying the
                           sea and the activity itself, sailing trips bring
                           several benefits to students.<br />
                           The curriculum offered includes basic seafaring
                           notions such as knot lessons, how to manage the
                           rudder and sails and knowing how to position yourself
                           in relation to the wind and to the space to get the
                           most out of it. <br />First, the activity is
                           developed in a fun way in small groups with a
                           monitor, but the aim is for them to go to the boat
                           alone. It is when the students change roles, see
                           themselves alone in the middle of the sea, become
                           empowered and develop their autonomy in confidence.

                           That's why we created some timeless multi-session

                           convenience. <br />The individual begins to navigate

                           learning progresses, he has the possibility of
                           reaching the modality of navigating autonomously,

                        <p>
                           In those years, windsurfing was beginning to be
                           accessible to everyone and aroused great curiosity
                           among young people and adults. It was a discipline
                           that gradually became integrated in all sailing
                           schools. <br/>Windsurfing is a sport that improves balance
                           and aerobic capacity. It also strengthens the joints
                           and muscles of the hands, arms and back. It helps to
                           develop muscle resistance. It strengthens self-esteem
                           and personal autonomy. De-stress by the production of
                           adrenaline. It is recommended for all ages as it can
                           be practiced at different skill levels.
